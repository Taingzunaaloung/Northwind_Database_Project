The yearly revenue chart on its own shows an increase in revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 and a dip in revenue compared to 2018. The revenue comparison chart provides more context in that, the company operated from July which is the onset to December of 2016(6 months), all of 2017(12 months) and January to May(5 months). The chart therefore indicates a gradual increase in revenue for the same time period in the  subsequent year. Revenue for the second half of 2017 saw an increase as compared to the same period in 2016. the same trend is observed for the first 5 months of 2017 compared to 2018. Although the time period of Jan-Dec is 5 months, there is still an increase in sales as compared to the previous 6 months, clearly indicating growth in revenue.
An exact profit or loss statement cannot be made since there is no data for other expenditure such as employee compensation, tax obligation and costs associated with storage

In terms of sales, the first chart suggests that there is no link between the number of sales and the number of territories assigned to an employee. This is seen in Margaret, Janet and Nancy, despite having the lowest number of territories assigned to them have the highest number of sales while Robert, Steven and Anne, with more territories assigned have some of the lowest sales in terms of product number. One hypothesis is that, employees with higher sales numbers are have, territories with much higher populations and as such are given a small number of territories to enable them handle the demands of the higher population while those with lower sales have numerous territories with small populations. Since the database has no data on the populations of the territories, this hypothesis could not be tested

The second chart suggests a direct correlation between the number of orders and the number of products sales, with increasing orders resulting in increasing product sales

### Low Ordering Countries

### Effect of Discounts on Purchasing Patterns of each Country
![Effect of Discounts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119953557/232348524-d0514512-4b31-4e10-acc6-359e026e6586.png)
With the exception of Ireland, Canada, Italy and Portugal, non discount purchases for the most part are slightly higher than discount purchases. Poland, Norway and Argentina, 3 of the 5 countries with the least ordered items have no discount purchases probably due to no discount campaigns, an opportunity which can be utilized to achieve about 20-50% increase in sales. To arrive at a much better conclusion on the effect of discounts, data on the duration of the discount period is needed, which unfortunately is lacking 

### Delayed Orders per Country
![Delayed Orders per Country](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119953557/232348585-f0071632-b5d0-4588-aa47-3725e8c5e06c.png)
Relative to number of orders, Mexico, Italy, Finland, Poland and Norway have high incidence of delayed orders. Poland and Norway have the worst record of 85% and 100% delays respectively, although this can be attributed to their significantly small number of orders of 7 and 6, which also makes them the countries with the least amount of orders
